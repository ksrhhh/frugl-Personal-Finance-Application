# frugl

## Software Design Project - Fall 2025
### MONEY TREES (Group 3)

## Project Summary

Frugl is a swing-based Personal Financial Management application that transforms raw bank statements into actionable insight. It simplifies financial tracking by allowing users to import bank statements for automated categorization and autosaving. Also, the app promotes mindful spending through intuitive visualizations and a gamified system for setting and tracking monthly spending goals.

The user navigates our app from the main dashboard, where they can import bank statements from their local files and select a date range to visualize a breakdown of spending, inflows, and outflows. The user can also view monthly individual transactions and set goals using an interactive “financial forest,” where each goal creates a tree in their goal forest.

### Structure of the App
Our application is built on Clean Architecture and SOLID principles, with excellent Code Quality. Thus, our front-end UI elements operate independently of our core back-end logic, improving maintainability and collaboration. Our app runs locally, processes bank statements from JSON files using Gemini, and displays colourful charts via QuickChart.io.

### QuickChart.io API
API Link: https://quickchart.io/chart?c= _{your chart here}_

API Usage: Visualizing financial data by spending category (pie chart) and by inflow and outflow over time (time chart).

Instructions:
The application constructs QuickChart JSON configurations to visualize data through renderers.
* **Pie Chart Renderer:** Aggregates expense data by category.
* **Time Chart Renderer:** Generates a **stacked bar chart** comparing "Income" vs. "Expenses" over time.

The JSON strings are URL-encoded and appended to the API base URL. The application then fetches the generated image directly as an input stream (`ImageIO.read`) to display in the dashboard without saving local files.

### JSON Data
- transactions.json
- source_categories.json
- goals.json
